\subsection{BSA}
\label{ssec:BSA}
The Software Alliance (changed its name from \underline{B}usiness \underline{S}oftware \underline{A}lliance) is an advocate group representing the interests of the software industry in countries around the world. It was established in 1988 and has its headquarters in Washington DC. Notable members include, amongst others, Adobe, Apple, Autodesk, IBM, Microsoft, Oracle, and Siemens. The current CEO, Victoria Espinel, studied to become a Telecomms lawyer before being appointed as advisor on intellectual property issues of President Obama in 2009 and subsequent appointment to her current position inside the BSA. \parencite{Rogers2017}
\vspace{\baselineskip}

\noindent The BSA's mission is based on three overriding policies:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Safeguarding intellectual property rights and protections
	\item Opening global markets to digital trade
	\item Enabling the growth of cloud 
\end{itemize}
\parencite{BSA2017}


To reach this stated goal the Software Alliance believes that patents, copyrights, trademarks, and other IP rights should be comprehensive and enforceable. Trading partners, wether on a global or local scale, should not use their legislation to favour local industries or discourage international competition. And lastly, companies should not abuse their intellectual property to create unfair competitive advantage.

The BSA concentrated it's effort for pushing the cloud in pushing for specific policies advancing the cloud, forging bilateral or multilateral agreements that eases the movement of data across borders. It promotes the use of sound data protection practices to expand and fortify the public trust in digital commerce. But even these data protection policies should leave enough leeway for technological innovation and new sevices, especially cloud computing.

The BSA garnered critic for aggressively enforcing the licence rights of its members under the guise of "audits" and providing bounties for people providing hints of unlicensed software use in companies. Due to high penalties for unlicensed software and the need for very extensive proof of ownership, many small and medium sized businesses failed to provide ample documentation and were subsequently fined. Some of these businesses even to the point of bankruptcy. These actions garnered the BSA the label to be akin to a bully and not the shining knight for IT innovation as stated in their mission statement. \parencite{Gaskin2009}

\subsection{SIIA}
\label{ssec:SIIA}
Similar to the BSA the Software and Information Industry Association (SIIA) is a trade-group advocating and defending the rights and interests of big software companies. Notable members include, amongst many others, Apple, Facebook, Goldman Sachs and even Credit Suisse. The SIIA has the stated goal of promoting, protecting and informing the software and digital industry. Also similar to the BSA it has an anti-piracy reward program offering up to 1000000\$. \parencite{SIIAreward}

Critics accuse the SIIA to use the complex and confusing IP laws to extort money from small- and medium sized businesses in what is essentially a shakedown. \parencite{Melymuka2006}
